        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Information technology and telecommunications are two areas that I have been working on for more than 15 years ago.  
            They both are related and, in some point, intertwin to deliver seamless solutions to end users such as mobile phone users. 
            Starting as a technology sales representative helps anybody to understand how technology change cycles are and how market 
            trends affect the lives of everyone. With the addition of customer service and client management you start to get an idea 
            of what is ahead of you in the technology business. </p>

        <p> Switching to a help desk position. Working with end users, helping them with their issues and problems, you build a strong 
            base to define your career path. Deciding if you want to do end user support, programming, networking, or system administration 
            among other specializations is the name of the game.</p>
            
        <p> Leaning towards networking I took a Voice Over IP support position where I learnt the importance of telecommunications over information technology. 
            The next hop was a system administration position where I worked with UNIX servers, specifically SUN Solaris operative system. 
            I learn how to install hardware and software, how to troubleshoot operative system issues. I had the opportunity to learn and administer storage devices. 
            Big machine racks with petabytes of information at the service of telecom industries.
            The last years have been in the project management field, certifying myself as a Project Manager Professional or PMP has allowed 
            me to put all necessary experience into practice. By managing from small to large projects, dealing with uncertainty and changing priorities.
            
        <p>What’s ahead is to apply the knowledge, skills and experience to the new country and its industry particularities. Starting by 
            reaffirming knowledge at college and securing a diploma for future opportunities.

                <h4>The first Belize trip</h4>
                <p>As part of the experience been a UNIX system administrator I traveled to different countries in central America. 
                    The pictures you are about to see where taken on the first trip I did to Belize, where we had to configure a new storage attached network device AKA “SAN”. 
                    I was a trainee at the time and started to realize the intricacies of navigating datacenters and protocols to follow.

                <h4>The server room migration</h4>
                <a>
                    <p>One of the projects I am proud of during my system administrator period is the physical migration of a server room.
                    We were tasked with moving the physical servers from the old server room that had been decommissioned to a brand-new server room with proper lightning and climate control.</p>
                    
                    <p>The task was critical. Move 10 racks with its servers to a room 2 levels below. No cargo elevator and not able to execute t during daytime. We had to be up and running by 6 am next morning.</p>
                    <br>
                    In the pictures you will find some of the racks and the people that made it possible.

                <h4> Solar power for a rural community</h4>
                <a>
                    <p>You live in the 21st century. All commodities exist and you have hydro, gas, running water, all at your disposal and in your residence.</p>
                        
                    <p>Now imagine that for getting water you need to walk about a mile through a river that is 30 mts downhill. That is just to get there, 
                        then you get back through the same way you came from. JUST TO GET WATER.</p>
                    
                    <p>Now you barely have a mobile phone signal, but nowhere to charge your phone, or to light up your phone. In fact, you need to walk for 1hr. 
                        to the nearest place where you could plug the phone into a power outlet.</p>
                    <p>That is this little village that has 3 families in desperate need of services. My wife, brother-in-law and I partnered to give some relief 
                        to these families. We set up a solar power plant, 
                        a small 300wts off grid plant with enough batteries to illuminate two houses and set up some power sockets to charge small devices such as phones.</p>
